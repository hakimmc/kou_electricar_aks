# STM32 serial driver

This is a very simple, Arduino-inspired library for serial functionality on STM32 devices.

It relies on the *low-level* (`LL_USART`) library from the STM32Cube drivers.

The following STM32 device families have been tested.
* STM32F3
* STM32F4
* STM32L1

Porting to other devices should be trivial.
